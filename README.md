# programming-language
based on assembly a simple programming language I made, don't roast the code as it was the second program I made without ai or a tutorial though it was inspired by the following youtube video hence why it was stack based: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3gTw1ZkeK0 , also I don't know how to write a compiler so interpreted it is
steps to work:
step 1: download python, any version newer than python 3.9 will do
step 2: write a script or download the presets
step 3: save your file with a .oll extention, IT WILL NOT WORK IF THE EXTENTION IS NOT .OLL to fix this you can go into the main.py file, and remove the .oll from the line:
with open(f"{path}.oll") as f
step 4: run the python script through the command line, include the name of your file not including the .oll extention
step 5: enjoy :)
